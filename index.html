                        Hayrettin Karaca was born on the 4th of April 1922 in Bandirma, Turkey. His father and mother immigrated from Crimea. After graduating high-school he started to manage his family's textile factories and has grown the business to be one of the leading companies in the industry. He explains his early carrer path: "I didn't want to be a businessman, what I wanted was to study literature and be close to nature. However, back then, it was out of the question to go against your parents' wishes."
